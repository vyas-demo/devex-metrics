# Copilot Instructions

## Project overview

**devex-metrics** collects Developer Experience metrics from the GitHub API for a GitHub organisation or user account and produces a Markdown report and an HTML dashboard deployed to GitHub Pages, including Developer Insights velocity analytics (throughput, flow, cycle predictability, lead time, and PR size). No data is committed to the repository; collected data lives in `data/` (gitignored, persisted via `actions/cache` in CI).

## Tech stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, ES2022 target, Node16 module resolution)
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22, ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **GitHub API**: `@octokit/rest` + `@octokit/auth-app` + `@octokit/plugin-throttling`
- **Tests**: Vitest with globals enabled (`vitest.config.ts`)
- **Build**: `tsc` → `dist/`
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs build + test on every PR/push)

## Code conventions

- **Imports**: always use the `.js` extension (required for Node16 ESM), e.g. `import { foo } from "./foo.js"`.
- **Types**: define all shared interfaces in `src/types.ts`. Add JSDoc comments to every exported interface and property.
- **Functions**: prefer named exports over default exports.
- **Error handling**: surface errors early; avoid swallowing exceptions silently.
- **No `any`**: use `unknown` and narrow with type guards instead.
- **Async**: use `async/await` throughout; avoid raw `.then()` chains.
- **Comments**: only add comments when intent is non-obvious; avoid restating what the code already expresses clearly.

## Adding a new collector

1. Create `src/collectors/<name>.ts` and `src/collectors/<name>.test.ts`.
2. Export a single async function that accepts an Octokit instance plus whatever parameters it needs and returns a typed value.
3. Re-export from `src/collectors/index.ts`.
4. Add the new metric fields to the relevant interface in `src/types.ts`.
5. Wire up the collector in `src/collect.ts`, surface the data in `src/report.ts` and `src/build-pages.ts`.
6. **If the new field is required for correct behaviour** (e.g. the chart filter depends on it), bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `src/cache.ts` and add a line to the version history comment there. This invalidates all cached/fixture data that pre-dates the change and forces a fresh collection on the next run.
7. Write tests using vitest (see Testing section below for patterns).

## Cache schema versioning

`CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` is exported from `src/cache.ts`. It is stored in every `OrgMetrics` object produced by `collect.ts`. When data is loaded from disk (`loadCache`, `loadRawCache`, `loadFixture`), the stored version is compared to the constant; a mismatch causes the loader to return `null` so the caller falls back to a fresh API collection.

**When to bump the version:** any time a new field is added to `OrgMetrics` (or a nested type) that the dashboard or report rely on and that would be absent in data collected with an older build. Increment by 1, update the version-history comment in `cache.ts`, and update `makeSampleMetrics()` in `cache.test.ts` if needed.

**Do not** bump the version for purely additive optional fields where the absence can be handled gracefully with a fallback.

## Testing

- All test files live alongside the source file they test: `src/foo.test.ts` tests `src/foo.ts`.
- Run tests with `npm test` (vitest, single run) or `npm run test:watch` (watch mode).
- Tests use vitest globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) — no imports needed for those, though explicit imports are fine for clarity.
- **CI runs `npm test` on every PR and push to `main`** — all tests must pass before merging.

### Mock patterns

**API collectors** (`collectors/*.ts`) — inject a fake Octokit via `setOctokit` / `resetOctokit`:

```ts
import { setOctokit, resetOctokit } from "../github-client.js";

afterEach(() => resetOctokit());

it("counts correctly", async () => {
  setOctokit({ rest: { ... }, paginate: { ... } } as unknown as Octokit);
  const result = await collectFoo("owner", "repo");
  expect(result).toEqual(...);
});
```

For collectors that use `paginate.iterator`, create an async generator and attach it:

```ts
async function* fakeIterator() { yield { data: [...] }; }
const paginateFn = Object.assign(vi.fn(), { iterator: fakeIterator });
```

**Orchestrators** (`collect.ts`) — use `vi.mock` to replace the cache and collector modules:

```ts
vi.mock("./cache.js", () => ({ loadCache: vi.fn(), saveCache: vi.fn(), ... }));
vi.mock("./collectors/index.js", () => ({ collectRepos: vi.fn(), ... }));
// imports below receive the mocked versions
import { collect } from "./collect.js";
```

**Pure functions** (`report.ts`, `link-header.ts`) — call directly; no mocking needed.

### What to test

- **Happy path**: verify the correct shape and values of the result.
- **Error paths**: 404 returns a zero/empty default; 403 returns a zero/empty default *and* calls `console.warn`; non-404/403 errors are re-thrown.
- **Partial failures**: in collectors with independent `try/catch` blocks (e.g. `contributors.ts`), verify that one path failing does not zero out the other.
- **Edge cases**: empty repos, pagination (multiple pages accumulate), deduplication, null fields with defined fallbacks.
- Avoid testing implementation details or mocking things that don't need it. Don't aim for 100% coverage — focus on behaviours that could regress.

## Mutation testing

Mutation testing is provided by [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) with the vitest runner.

- **Config**: `stryker.config.mjs` (ESM). Mutates all `src/**/*.ts` except test files, `types.ts`, `index.ts`, `save-fixture.ts`, and `build-pages.ts` (the last is excluded because its tests run via subprocess and Stryker cannot track coverage that way).
- **Run locally** (before creating a PR): `npm run mutation` — produces an HTML report at `reports/mutation/index.html` and a text summary in the terminal.
- **Run in CI mode**: `npm run mutation:ci` — outputs JSON + text (no HTML). The `mutation` job in `ci.yml` reads `reports/mutation/mutation.json` and posts a Markdown summary to the GitHub Actions step summary via `node scripts/mutation-summary.mjs >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
- **Thresholds**: `high: 80`, `low: 60` for colour-coding only; `break: null` so the CI job never fails purely on score. Tighten `break` once you have a stable baseline.
- **Interpreting results**: a survived mutant means a code change was not caught by any test — it may indicate a test gap worth addressing. NoCoverage mutants mean no test exercises that line at all.
- **reports/** is gitignored — never commit Stryker output.

## GitHub Actions

- **ci.yml**: runs `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test` on every push/PR to `main`. A second `mutation` job (depends on `test`) runs Stryker and posts a step summary; it runs on every PR but does not block merging on score.
- **collect-metrics.yml**: scheduled daily; restores cache, collects metrics, builds Pages, deploys. Does **not** commit to `main`.
- Always pin action versions to a full SHA or major-version tag.

## Auth

The CLI supports two auth modes, selected by environment variables:

| Mode | Variables required |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| PAT / OAuth | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| GitHub App | `APP_ID` + `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` |

The GitHub App mode is preferred for production (fine-grained permissions, higher rate limits). The installation ID is discovered automatically.
